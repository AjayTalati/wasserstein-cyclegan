# wasserstein-cyclegan
CycleGAN with Wasserstein Loss

Adds [Wasserstein Loss](https://arxiv.org/abs/1701.07875) to [CycleGAN](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1703.10593.pdf). Implementation builds upon the [pytorch-CycleGAN](https://github.com/junyanz/pytorch-CycleGAN-and-pix2pix) implementation.

### Status:
This is work in progress and the convergence of Wasserstein GAN is not great right now.

### TODO:
- [ ] Add results.
- [ ] Use [Improved Training of Wasserstein GAN](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1704.00028.pdf).
- [ ] Experiment with different architectures.
